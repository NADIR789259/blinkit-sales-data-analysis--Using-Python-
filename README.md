🚀 Blinkit Sales Data Analysis Project | Python EDA
I’m excited to share that I have successfully completed my Blinkit Sales Data Analysis Project using Python.
In this project, I performed a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Blinkit's retail dataset to extract meaningful business insights and understand the key factors driving sales performance.
The main objective of this project was to transform raw retail data into actionable business intelligence through structured data cleaning, preprocessing, aggregation, and visualization.
